## ü§ñ <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>


In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of deploying a Flask web application on an AWS EC2 instance. Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python, and AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud.

## üîã  <a name="features">Features</a>

- Deploy a Flask web application on AWS EC2.
- Use Gunicorn as the WSGI server.
- Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy.


## ‚öôÔ∏è <a name="tech-stack">Tech Stacks</a>

- Python
- Flask
- AWS EC2
- Gunicorn
- Nginx


## üìÇ <a name="table">Folder Structure</a>

- **helloworld/**
  - **venv/**
  - **app.py**
 

## üß∞ <a name="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask
- Familiarity with the Linux command line

## **Steps**

### **1. Install Python Virtual Environment**

First, SSH into your EC2 instance and update the package list:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Then, install the Python virtual environment package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

### **2. Set up the Virtual Environment**

Create a new directory for your Flask app and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
```

Create a virtual environment named 'venv':

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **3. Install Flask**

Within the virtual environment, install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### **4. Create a Simple Flask API**

Create a file named **`app.py`** 

```jsx
sudo vi app.py
```

And add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

```

### **5. Verify Flask App**

Run the Flask app to verify it works:

```bash
python app.py
```

### **6. Run Gunicorn WSGI Server**

Run Gunicorn WSGI server to serve the Flask Application When you ‚Äúrun‚Äù flask, you are actually running Werkzeug‚Äôs development WSGI server, which forward requests from a web server. Since Werkzeug is only for development, we have to use Gunicorn, which is a production-ready WSGI server, to serve our application.

Install Gunicorn using pip:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Run Gunicorn to serve the Flask application:

```bash
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

**Gunicorn is running (Ctrl + C to exit gunicorn)!**

Use systemd to manage Gunicorn Systemd is a boot manager for Linux. We are using it to restart gunicorn if the EC2 restarts or reboots for some reason. We create a .service file in the /etc/systemd/system folder, and specify what would happen to gunicorn when the system reboots. We will be adding 3 parts to systemd Unit file ‚Äî Unit, Service, Install

Unit ‚Äî This section is for description about the project and some dependencies Service ‚Äî To specify user/group we want to run this service after. Also some information about the executables and the commands. Install ‚Äî tells systemd at which moment during boot process this service should start. With that said, create an unit file in the /etc/systemd/system directory

### **7. Manage Gunicorn with systemd**

Create a systemd unit file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/helloworld.service
```

Add the following configuration:

```
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance for a simple hello world app
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/helloworld
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/helloworld/venv/bin/gunicorn -b localhost:8000 app:app
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start helloworld
sudo systemctl enable helloworld
```

Check if the app is running with

```bash
curl localhost:8000
```

Run Nginx Webserver to accept and route request to Gunicorn Finally, we set up Nginx as a reverse-proxy to accept the requests from the user and route it to gunicorn.

### **8. Set up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**

Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Start and enable the Nginx service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

Edit the Nginx default configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Add the following code at the top of the file (below the default comments)

```
upstream flaskhelloworld {
    server 127.0.0.1:8000;
}
```

Add a proxy_pass to flaskhelloworld atlocation /

```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://flaskhelloworld;
}
```

Restart Nginx for changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Now, your Flask application should be accessible via your EC2 instance's public IP address.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Flask web application on an AWS EC2 instance using Gunicorn and Nginx as a reverse proxy.
